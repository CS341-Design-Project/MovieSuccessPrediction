Our project aims to use the TensorFlow framework to build an ML model to predict the success of a movie using data mining. We also intend to deploy this model in a web application with an intuitive interface for a better user experience. 
In order to do this We will develop a prediction methodology based on historical data. Some of the criteria involved in calculating success includes actor, budget, director, producer, story writer, music, release date and competing movies. 
This method helps to find out whether the movie is super hit, hit, average or flop and users can easily decide whether to watch the movie or not.

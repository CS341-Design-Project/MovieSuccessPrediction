Movies have a major effect on real life, whether we realize it or not. A movie can inspire you to make positive changes in your life – even if it’s only a small change! 
Web content mining is intended to help people discover valuable information from large amount of unstructured data on the web. With the rapid development of the Web, online review is becoming more and more useful and an important information resource for the same. Nowadays, a large number of reviews are posted by the moviegoers on the Web, providing valuable information to other audiences. Such information is highly essential for decision making and hence popular among the internet users. This information is very valuable not only for prospective audiences to make decisions but also for movie-maker in predicting the success and acceptance of the movie. 
Our project aims to use the TensorFlow framework to build an ML model to predict the success of a movie using data mining. We also intend to deploy this model in a web application with an intuitive interface for a better user experience. In order to do this, we will develop a prediction methodology based on historical data. Some of the criteria involved in calculating success includes actor, budget, director, producer, story writer, music, release date and so on. This method helps to predict the success of the movie in terms of acceptance by the audiences, which will in turn aid both the movie-maker and the moviegoers.

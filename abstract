Our project aims to use the TensorFlow framework to build an ML model to predict the success of a movie using data mining. We also intend to deploy this model in a web application with an intuitive interface for a better user experience. 
In order to do this We will develop a prediction methodology based on historical data. Some of the criteria involved in calculating success includes actor, budget, director, producer, story writer, music, release date and competing movies.
